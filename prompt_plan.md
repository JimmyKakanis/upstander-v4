## Phase 1: Basic Setup and Reporting (Complete)

- [x] Initial Next.js project setup.
- [x] Anonymous reporting form for students.
- [x] Secure admin dashboard for staff.
- [x] Firebase integration for Auth and Firestore.

## Phase 2: Debugging and Stabilization (Complete)

**Date:** 2025-09-07

**Summary:** This phase involved a deep and extensive debugging session to resolve a critical issue preventing admin users from logging in. The application would get stuck on a "Loading..." screen due to a series of cascading configuration and code issues.

**Key Issues Resolved:**

1.  **Vercel Environment Variables:** Confirmed that for a live deployment, environment variables must be set in the Vercel dashboard, not in a local `.env.local` file.
2.  **Google Cloud Project Configuration:**
    *   **Billing:** A Google Cloud billing account was linked to the Firebase project, which is a requirement for Firestore to function correctly.
    *   **API Enablement:** Verified that the "Cloud Firestore API" was enabled.
    *   **API Key Restrictions:** Confirmed that the Firebase API key had the correct permissions for both "Identity Toolkit API" (Authentication) and "Cloud Firestore API".
3.  **Firestore Security Rules Deployment:** The most critical finding was that `firestore.rules` are **not** automatically deployed with the application. The live rules in the Firebase Console were incorrect and blocking all access. The issue was resolved by manually copying the correct rules from the local file and publishing them in the Firebase Console.
4.  **Application Code Hardening:** Added robust `try...catch...finally` error handling to the dashboard page. This prevents the application from getting stuck on a loading screen and ensures that any future data-fetching errors are clearly logged in the browser console.

**Current Status:** The admin login functionality is now fully operational. The application is stable and the core features from Phase 1 are working as expected.

## Phase 3: Next Steps

- [ ] Feature: Follow-up system for anonymous users using their reference code.
- [ ] UI/UX: General improvements to the reporting form and admin dashboard.
- [ ] Testing: Implementation of automated tests.
