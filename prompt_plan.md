## Phase 1: Basic Setup and Reporting (Complete)

- [x] Initial Next.js project setup.
- [x] Anonymous reporting form for students.
- [x] Secure admin dashboard for staff.
- [x] Firebase integration for Auth and Firestore.

## Phase 2: Debugging and Stabilization (Complete)

**Date:** 2025-09-07

**Summary:** This phase involved a deep and extensive debugging session to resolve a critical issue preventing admin users from logging in. The application would get stuck on a "Loading..." screen due to a series of cascading configuration and code issues.

**Key Issues Resolved:**

1.  **Vercel Environment Variables:** Confirmed that for a live deployment, environment variables must be set in the Vercel dashboard, not in a local `.env.local` file.
2.  **Google Cloud Project Configuration:**
    *   **Billing:** A Google Cloud billing account was linked to the Firebase project, which is a requirement for Firestore to function correctly.
    *   **API Enablement:** Verified that the "Cloud Firestore API" was enabled.
    *   **API Key Restrictions:** Confirmed that the Firebase API key had the correct permissions for both "Identity Toolkit API" (Authentication) and "Cloud Firestore API".
3.  **Firestore Security Rules Deployment:** The most critical finding was that `firestore.rules` are **not** automatically deployed with the application. The live rules in the Firebase Console were incorrect and blocking all access. The issue was resolved by manually copying the correct rules from the local file and publishing them in the Firebase Console.
4.  **Application Code Hardening:** Added robust `try...catch...finally` error handling to the dashboard page. This prevents the application from getting stuck on a loading screen and ensures that any future data-fetching errors are clearly logged in the browser console.

**Current Status:** The admin login functionality is now fully operational. The application is stable and the core features from Phase 1 are working as expected.

## Phase 3: Feature Implementation & Bug Fixing (In Progress)

**Date:** 2025-09-08

**Summary:** This phase focused on implementing the student follow-up feature and debugging a persistent issue with the admin dashboard not displaying reports.

**Completed Work:**

- **Student Follow-up Feature:**
  - Implemented a secure system allowing students to check their report status using a unique reference code.
  - Created a new `followUpAccess` collection in Firestore to securely link public reference codes to private report IDs.
  - Refactored the report submission process to use a Firestore transaction, ensuring the report and the follow-up document are created together atomically.
  - Updated Firestore security rules to allow this secure, anonymous access.

**Unresolved Issues:**

- **Admin Dashboard Not Loading Reports:**
  - **Symptom:** Admins can log in successfully, but the dashboard does not display any reports for their assigned school, even when reports exist in the database.
  - **Debugging Steps Taken:**
    1.  Verified the dashboard application code is correctly fetching the admin's `schoolId` and using it in the Firestore query.
    2.  Confirmed with the user that the `schoolId` in the `admins` collection matches the `schoolId` in the `reports` collection exactly.
    3.  Identified and corrected a critical bug in the `firestore.rules` `allow list` rule, changing it from the incorrect `request.query.schoolId` to the correct `resource.data.schoolId`.
  - **Current Status:** Despite these fixes, the issue persists. The root cause is still unknown and will be the top priority for the next session.

## Phase 4: Future Work
- [ ] UI/UX: General improvements to the reporting form and admin dashboard.
- [ ] Testing: Implementation of automated tests.
