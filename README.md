# Upstander: Anonymous Bullying Reporting App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for Upstander, an anonymous bullying reporting application. The goal of this application is to provide a safe and confidential way for students to report incidents of bullying, and a secure dashboard for school administrators to manage and address these reports.

## Core Features

- **Anonymous Reporting:** Students can submit reports without revealing their identity.
- **Secure Admin Dashboard:** School staff can log in to view and manage reports for their specific school.
- **Report Management:** Admins can view report details, update the status of an investigation, and add private notes.
- **Unique Reference Codes:** Each report is assigned a unique, non-identifiable code that students can use for follow-up conversations.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
